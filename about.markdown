Hi! My name is Ellen Fitzsimmons, and I am a PhD student in Quantitative Psychology at the University of Missouri. My research of interest is Bayesian SEM with a focus on model fit metrics in Bayesian SEM, but I also have extensive experience in other research topics like power analyses, machine learning, and IRT. One of my favorite parts of research is figuring out a problem through coding in R, but the mess visible on GitHub may not reflect that.
