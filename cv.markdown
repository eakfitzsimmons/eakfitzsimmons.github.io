# Research

**Dissertation Research** Fall 2021 -- Present

*University of Missouri, Columbia, MO*

- Explore use of ppp-value as a person fit statistic, e.g., using ppp-values for outlier and influential observation detection

- Investigate solutions for double counting problem and optimistic bias that occurs during ppp-value calculation

- Generalize ppp-value calculation code and make available through a public Git repository

**Graduate Research Assistant**	Fall 2019 -- Summer 2021

*University of Missouri, Columbia, MO*

- Research assistant for developing flexible, user-friendly statistical software for power analysis

- Coded R base syntax for power calculation for a variety of statistical models and conducted rigorous testing of code to ensure software produces expected results

- Oversaw big picture goals for the project and created training materials for graduate and undergraduate coders

- Assisted in designing Graphical User Interface 


**Master’s Thesis Research**	Summer 2019 -- Spring 2021

*University of Missouri, Columbia, MO*

- Wrote R code for calculation and comparison of Bayesian model fit statistic (the ppp-value) calculated with a standard method and a novel method 

- Built and estimated multiple Bayesian CFA and Latent Growth Models for comparison of the two model fit statistics for each model

- We found a trend of the novel method of calculating the fit statistic indicating better fit than the standard method

**Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling in Stan** Summer 2019

*University of Missouri, Columbia, MO*

- Studied a more efficient approach to Bayesian SEM estimation in Stan

- Wrote R code that modeled data in JAGS, the old Stan approach (classic Stan), and the new Stan approach (Stan)

- Compared effective sample size per second for the models built in JAGS, classic Stan, and Stan and created graphical depictions of results

**First-Year Project** Fall 2018 -- Summer 2019

*University of Missouri, Columbia, MO*

- Learned how to use TensorFlow Probability, a Python library that combines probabilistic models and deep learning

- Compared the effective sample size, processing speed, and results that TensorFlow Probability and Stan produced for different types of models (e.g. linear regression and hierarchical linear regression)


# Teaching Experience

**TA PSYCH 3020 (Research Methods in Psychology II)** Spring 2019

*University of Missouri, Columbia, MO*

- Created homework assignments on online course management system (MyOpenMath) that tested theoretical and applied knowledge of statistical concepts

- Taught students how to write R code for statistical computation

- Graded homework assignments and tests 


**TA for PSYCH 3830 (Health Psychology)**	Fall 2018

*University of Missouri, Columbia, MO*

- Graded homework assignments, classwork, and final projects and managed gradebook on Canvas learning management system

- Guided class activities and discussions about class material

- Taught guest lectures on select health psychology topics
